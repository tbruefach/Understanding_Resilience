# Understanding_Resilience
"Understanding Resilience as More than an Individual Resource." These aggregated data and visualizations are drawn from my dissertation examining racial/ethnic differences in associations between psychological resilience and health over the life course.

Data come from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). Researchers may access a public version of these data or can request access through their university or institution, by visiting the website https://addhealth.cpc.unc.edu/.
