# Understanding_Resilience
"Understanding Resilience as More than an Individual Resource." These aggregated data and visualizations are drawn from my dissertation examining racial/ethnic differences in associations between psychological resilience and health over the life course.

Data come from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (Add Health). Researchers may access a public version of these data through ICPSR, or can request access to restricted data through their university or institution by visiting the website https://addhealth.cpc.unc.edu/.
